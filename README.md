# Experimental Radar Model (ExRaM)

## Overview

This personal project is a radar model developed specifically for training purposes, aimed at implementing and exploring various radar signal processing techniques. 
The model is intended to provide a simulation environment to practice algorithms, visualize results, and understand the fundamentals of radar signal processing.

## Intended Features

- **Signal Generation**: Simulate radar signals with different targets, noise levels, and interference.
- **Signal Processing Techniques**: Implement and test algorithms such as:
  - **Matched Filtering**
  - **Pulse Compression**
  - **Doppler Processing**
  - **Beamforming**
  - **CFAR (Constant False Alarm Rate) Detection**
- **Visualization Tools**: Graphical representation of signal processing steps, including range-Doppler maps, power spectra, and detection plots.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Easily adjust radar parameters such as pulse width, PRF (Pulse Repetition Frequency), bandwidth, and antenna configurations.
- **Modular Design**: Allows integration of new algorithms and signal processing modules for extended training.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Spare13Fuze/ExRaM.git
